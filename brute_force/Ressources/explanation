Vulenrability name: Broken Authentication (Brute force attack).
Vulenrability desc: Application functions related to authentication
                    and session management are often implemented incorrectly,
                    allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
                    or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume
                    other usersâ€™ identities temporarily or permanently.

Ways to prevent vulenrability from happening: 
    - Limit failed login attempts.
    - Use Captcha.
    - Two factor authentication.
