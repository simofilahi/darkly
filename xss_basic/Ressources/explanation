vulenrability name: Cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulenrability desc:  is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker
                     to compromise the interactions that users have with a
                     vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent
                     the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other.
                     Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user,
                     to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data.
                     If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able
                     to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.
