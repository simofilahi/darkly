Vulenrability name: Broken Authentication (Weak session).
Vulenrability desc: Application functions related to authentication
                    and session management are often implemented incorrectly,
                    allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens,
                    or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume
                    other usersâ€™ identities temporarily or permanently.

Ways to prevent vulenrability from happening:
    - Use strong encryption algorithem to encrypt session IDs.
    - Do not expose session ID in the URL: Session IDs should not be exposed in the URL (e.g., URL rewriting).
    - Session IDs should timeout: User sessions or authentication tokens should be properly invalidated during logout.
    - Recreate session IDs: Session IDs should be recreated after successful login.
    - Do not send credentials over unencrypted connections: Passwords, session IDs, and other credentials should not be sent over unencrypted connections.
