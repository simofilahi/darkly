Vulenrability name: Security Misconfigurations
Vulenrability desc: Attackers will often attempt to exploit unpatched flaws
                    or access default accounts, unused pages, unprotected
                    files and directories, etc to gain unauthorized access
                    or knowledge of the system.

Ways to prevent vulenrability from happening:
    - Wrong server configuration.
    - Files permissions.
    - Unnecessary ports being left open,
    - Unneeded services permitted to run,
    - Unused accounts with certain privileges not being deleted.
