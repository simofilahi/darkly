Vulenrability name: URL REDIRECTION.
Vulenrability desc: URL Redirection is a vulnerability which allows an attacker
                    to force users of your application to an untrusted external site.
                    The attack is most often performed by delivering a link to the victim,
                    who then clicks the link and is unknowingly redirected to the malicious
                    website.

Ways to prevent vulenrability from happening:
        - Prevent such attacks by ensuring that redirects
          in your applications are only done locally within your
          app or to a known URL, never to a URL provided in a query string.
        - For the external links it's perferable to do redirection from front-end.
